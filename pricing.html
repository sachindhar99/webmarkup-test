            <h2>In sports, technology has a bright future.</h2>
            <p>
                It is clear that all sports activities will continue to be fueled by this generation.
                Nevertheless, the decentralized generation has the ability to play a key role in the evolution of the sports 
                enterprise throughout the next decade. This is due in large part to their ability to engage fans and monetize them. 
                If it is combined with different new technologies designed to lure customers to eat products and services from their 
                preferred groups, it could become one of the most critical sales paths within the near future for sports activities groups and gamers.
                Until now,streaming technology was just not up to par. Now, thanks to faster internet speeds, more accessibility, and better hardware,
                we can deliver high-quality content to more people. This is really like the perfect wave of features paving the way for 
                cloud gaming to finally get the treatment it deserves. During the next six years (2022-2028), the Global Cloud Gaming 
                Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of around 60% and reach US$ 20 Bn in revenue. According to the GSMA, there were 5.2 
                billion smartphone connections worldwide in 2019 and by 2025, smartphone usage is expected to reach around 80%. As a result, 
                gaming developers are developing more mobile games.
